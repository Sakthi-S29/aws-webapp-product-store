# aws-webapp-product-store
This repository contains a web application deployed on AWS EC2 behind a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The app features two endpoints: `/store-products` to store product data in an AWS RDS database and `/list-products` to retrieve and display the stored products. It demonstrates EC2, RDS, and VPC integration for secure cloud architecture.
